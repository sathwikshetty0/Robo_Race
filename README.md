# Robo_Race
A step-by-step guide to building a custom RC race bot. This project features two detailed build options: a high-performance model with servo steering for maximum racing speed, and a unique, tank-style skid-steer model that operates without a servo. The guide includes full parts lists, wiring diagrams, and controller setup instructions.
